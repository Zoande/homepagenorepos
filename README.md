## Local Preview

Any static file server works. Example using Node:

```powershell
npx serve .
```

Then open the shown local URL.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository.
2. Import that repository in Vercel.
3. Add required environment variables from `.env.example` in Vercel Project Settings.
4. Deploy.

## Contact Form API Pipeline

The contact page now posts to a same-origin Vercel serverless route:

- `POST /api/contact-broker` (file: `api/contact-broker.js`)

The broker performs request validation and rate limiting, then forwards payloads to the receiver endpoint (Cloudflare tunnel -> laptop/Pi FastAPI service).

Required environment variables:

- `RECEIVER_CONTACT_URL`: public receiver endpoint, for example `https://ingest-dev.yourdomain.com/api/contact`
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: comma-separated origin allowlist, for example `https://elitedevs.org,https://www.elitedevs.org`

Optional environment variables:

- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`: single-origin fallback (backward compatibility)
- `RECEIVER_TOKEN`: shared token sent as `x-receiver-token`
- `BROKER_RATE_LIMIT_MAX`: requests per IP in one window (default `6`)
- `BROKER_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`: rate-limit window duration (default `60000`)
- `RECEIVER_TIMEOUT_MS`: upstream receiver timeout (default `7000`)

## Notes

- This deliverable is a unified project showcase + status tracker.
- Each page documents current implementation state and next delivery steps based on source inspection.
